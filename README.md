Language used : Python

Computer/User will guess a number between 1-100(or desired range) inclusive and the opposite has to guess it in minimum guesses.

For Computer : If, you guess a number lesser than the selected number, it will respond with "Higher number please" and vice versa.

-  Two gamemodes available.
-  If you feel computer is taking too long to guess, you can bail out.
-  Now, a player cannot cheat.
-  Implemented time,random and slowprint modules.
-  Guess counter.
-  Fix: Invalid input.
-  I can update the algorithm to bubble sort to guess the number faster,but decided not to since computers are smart anyways.
